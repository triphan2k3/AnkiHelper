## Introduction
 
Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn. 

Learning English vocabularies is amongst things Anki can do. However, Anki is highly-customizable and we have to self-prepare flashcards, which make the preparation a dull and time-consuming task.

This work aims to facilitate this uninterested phase by providing a pretty good tool which can auto-crawl information of English vocabularies on the two most famous online dictionaries, namely [Cambridge English Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/) and [Oxford Learner's Dictionaries](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/). After that, crawled information will be combined and dumped into an anki-importable file which means the only other thing that you have to do to have Anki flashcards is importing this file to Anki app.

## Default flashcards

I provided you with a template containing the following fields:

- *id*: a unique ID for the vocabulary generated by a specific rule (this field isn't really important but nice to have)
- *word*: the word we want to remember (EX: Ferris wheel, phenomenon)
- *plural_variant*: the variant of the word (EX: big wheel) or the plural version of it (if it is special EX: phenomena) if they exist.
- *word_type*: it can be verb, noun, adjective, adverb, idiom - you name it.
- *pronunciation*: the IPA of the word (EX: uk /ˈfer.ɪs ˌwiːl/ us /ˈfer.ɪs ˌwiːl/)
- *sound*: the audio files of the pronunciation of the word which are crawled from either dictionaries.
- *meaning*: the meanings of word (EX: a large, vertical wheel in an amusement park with seats that stay horizontal as the wheel turns round)
- *meaning_example*: examples help us have more profound understanding about the words, and each word can have more than one meaning. This field contains blocks, each of which is the meaning and some sentences using the word in the mentioned meaning.
- *hint*: There are many words having the same meaning (EX: silly, ridiculous, preposterous) and they can make you confuse. The default of this field is empty and if you confuse one word with others, you can add something into it to facilitate the retrieving process. For example, the leading character (s, r, p), a subtle meaning setting a word apart from others or even personal experience.
- *image*: By default, it's empty and you should add data into it whenever you feel it's necessary. Some words, especially nouns, have rather scientific meanings which are hard to conceive (EX: "a common animal with four legs, especially kept by people as a pet or to hunt or guard things" may hard to conceive as a dog, but with the below picture, you can sure the word is refering to "dog")

## Config in Anki

Firstly, you have to install Anki (you can follow this instruction [Getting Started](https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html))

If you use my template, you won't need to change anything from my code. By contrast, you have to give customization to **dump_to_importable** function in **main.py**.

Opt to use my template:

1. In Anki, import the **Template.apkg** via *File → Import → (Select Template.apkg)*
2. Now, we've had this card template in Anki. Deleting the just imported **Template** deck or keep it depend on you and it won't affect anything (I think it's better to delete it).

And that's about Anki.


## Requirement

```
python
bs4
selenium
```



## Using

0. delete **resource** folder as well as current urls in **_urls.txt**

1. Paste the links of vocabularies into the **_urls.txt** (only Cambridge and Oxford vocabulary links are accepted)


2. Run **main.py**

```
python main.py
```

3. Import the last csv file in **./resource/output** to Anki

4. Copy all files in **./resource/file** to the media location mentioned at [here](https://docs.ankiweb.net/files.html#file-locations)
